        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Don't sacrifice lasagna just because you don't like lasagna. This version packs lots of flavor from Parmesan and Asiago, and is made with few noodles so you low-carb dieters can enjoy it, too!</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
            <li>1 pound bulk hot Italian sausage</li>
            <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
            <li>½1 pint sliced fresh mushrooms</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 chipotle chile in adobo sauce, chopped</li>
            <li>1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste</li>
            <li>2 (15 ounce) cans stewed tomatoes</li>
            <li>sea salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>½ cup chopped fresh basils</li>
            <li>¼ cup chopped fresh oreganoe</li>
            <li>2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, at room temperature</li>
            <li>1 pound frozen chopped spinach, thawed</li>
            <li>9 lasagna noodles</li>
            <li>2 (8 ounce) balls of fresh mozzarella, sliced</li>
            <li>2 zucchini, thinly sliced lengthwise</li>
            <li>1 cup grated Asiago cheese</li>
            <li>1 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        </ul>

        <ol>
            <li>Cook and stir the ground beef and Italian sausage in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat until lightly browned. Drain any excess grease, then stir in the onion, mushrooms, and garlic. Cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes more. Stir in the chipotle chile, tomato paste, and stewed tomatoes. Bring to a simmer, then reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer for 15 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper, then stir in the basil and oregano; simmer 5 minutes more then remove from the heat.</li>
            <li>While the sauce is simmering, stir together the cream cheese and chopped spinach until blended. Leave the spinach soggy, the water will help thin out the cream cheese to a sour cream-like consistency.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Line the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish with a sheet of aluminum foil, and lightly grease. Place 3 lasagna noodles on the bottom of the pan, and spread with 1/3 of the spinach mixture. Spread 1/3 of the chipotle meat sauce over this, then layer with 1/3 of the mozzarella and 1/3 of the zucchini. Sprinkle with 1/3 of the Asiago cheese and 1/3 of the Parmesan cheeses. Repeat layers two more times, ending with cheeses on top.</li>
            <li>Cover the dish with aluminum foil, and bake in preheated oven for 40 minutes. Uncover, and continue baking until the top is bubbly and golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
